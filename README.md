Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
=======================================

My submission to the Titanic challenge on Kaggle. See [here](http://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted) for details. Uses the scikit-learn machine learning libraries for Python to fit a model to the training data (`train.csv`) and run it on the test data (`test.csv`). Predicts the survival of passengers in the test set and produces an output file (`titanic_predictions.csv`).

Prerequisites:
=============

Python 2.6+

[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

[NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)

Run:
===

From the command line:

    > python predict_survivors.py
